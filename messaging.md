# Hot Leads Weekly — Messaging Document

## Product Name

**Hot Leads Weekly**

"Signal Feed" sounds like a developer tool. "Hot Leads Weekly" is immediately clear to any recruiter: it tells you what it is (leads), what quality (hot), and how often (weekly). No explanation needed.

---

## One-Liner

Weekly curated feed of VP and C-level growth hires with real budgets, scored by signal richness for executive recruiters.

---

## Elevator Pitch (30 seconds)

Every week, we scan tens of thousands of new job postings and pull out the ones that actually matter for executive search: VP, SVP, and C-level roles where companies are growing, not backfilling. We tag each role with hiring signals — growth hire, first hire, reports to CEO — and score them by how high-stakes the search is likely to be. You get a ranked list every Monday morning with salary ranges, reporting structures, and direct links. Instead of spending your Monday morning sifting through LinkedIn and Indeed, you start with the 50 to 100 roles most likely to need outside help filling.

---

## Target Audience

**Primary:** Boutique and mid-size executive recruiting firms (5-50 recruiters) focused on sales, operations, and general management placements at the VP+ level.

**Secondary:** Independent retained search consultants and solo executive recruiters who lack a research team.

**Tertiary:** Recruiting firm principals evaluating market activity for business development — using the feed to identify companies in hiring mode and proactively pitch their services.

**Not a fit for:** High-volume staffing agencies, contingency recruiters focused on mid-level roles, or internal TA teams (they already see their own reqs).

---

## Value Proposition

### What they get that LinkedIn Recruiter cannot provide:

1. **Signal extraction.** LinkedIn shows you a job was posted. We tell you *why* it was posted — growth hire vs. turnaround vs. backfill — and what the reporting structure looks like. A VP of Sales who reports to the CEO and is building a team from scratch is a fundamentally different search than a VP of Sales backfilling under a CRO. LinkedIn does not make this distinction.

2. **Scoring and prioritization.** Every lead is ranked by signal richness, seniority, and salary. You open the email and the best opportunities are at the top. No filtering, no boolean searches, no saved alerts that return 300 results with 280 irrelevant ones.

3. **Budget confirmation.** We only include roles with posted compensation. If there is no salary range, there is no real budget authority behind the req. This eliminates tire-kicker postings and "we're always hiring" evergreen listings.

4. **Time saved.** A senior recruiter spending 2-3 hours per week monitoring job boards and setting up alerts can redirect that time to client conversations and candidate outreach. At $200/month, that is roughly $25/hour of recovered time for a person billing $100-300/hour.

### What they get that Indeed/job boards cannot provide:

Job boards are designed for job seekers, not recruiters. They optimize for volume and keyword matching. We optimize for the specific signals that indicate a company needs retained executive search help: first-hire roles, CEO direct reports, team-building mandates, and growth-stage hiring with real budgets.

## Pricing Strategy

### Recommended: $297/month

**Justification:**

- **Cost of alternative:** A junior researcher spending 3 hours/week on job board monitoring costs $15-25/hour = $180-300/month in labor alone, plus benefits, management overhead, and training. Hot Leads Weekly replaces this function completely.

- **Value of one placement:** A single VP-level placement fee at a retained search firm is $60,000-$150,000. If Hot Leads Weekly sources even one successful engagement per quarter, the ROI is 50-150x.

- **Market positioning:** $297/month is low enough to be a line-item expense approval (no committee needed), high enough to signal quality. Below $200 feels like a mass-market tool. Above $400 invites scrutiny and comparison to enterprise platforms like Thinknum or Revelio Labs.

**Pricing tiers to consider for v2:**

- **Starter ($197/month):** Weekly feed, CSV attachment, standard scoring
- **Professional ($297/month):** Weekly feed + custom filters (by industry, geography, function), priority scoring tuned to their practice areas
- **Firm ($497/month):** Everything in Professional + API access, multiple recipients, quarterly market intelligence report

**For MVP:** Single tier at $297/month. Keep it simple.

## Cold Outreach Email

**Subject:** 47 VP+ growth hires posted this week — want the list?

**Body:**

Hi {{FIRST_NAME}},

I run a data company that scrapes executive job postings and extracts hiring signals — things like whether a role is a growth hire vs. backfill, who it reports to, and whether there is a real salary budget behind it.

Every week we find 50-100 VP and C-level roles that look like they need outside help filling: first-hire leadership positions, CEO direct reports, team-building mandates with $200K+ budgets.

I would like to send you this week's report for free — no strings, no demo, no call required. Just reply "send it" and I will forward the full scored list.

If it saves you time, we can talk about a subscription. If it does not, no hard feelings.

Best,
Rome
Pariter Media Inc.

## Follow-Up Email (After Sample)

**Subject:** How was the list?

**Body:**

Hi {{FIRST_NAME}},

I sent over the Hot Leads Weekly sample last {{DAY}}. Wanted to check — did any of those leads line up with your current practice areas?

A few things subscribers tell us they use it for:

- **Monday morning prospecting.** Open the email, scan the top 10, and reach out to hiring managers before competitors see the posting.
- **Market intelligence.** Track which companies are in growth mode, which are restructuring, and where the budget authority is.
- **BD conversations.** Walk into a client meeting with data on how many competing roles are open and what they are paying.

The subscription is $297/month — roughly the cost of a junior researcher spending 3 hours a week doing what the feed does automatically.

Want to start? Reply and I will set you up for next Monday.

Best,
Rome

## Objection Handling

### "I already use LinkedIn Recruiter."

LinkedIn Recruiter is a candidate sourcing tool. It tells you who is available. Hot Leads Weekly is a *demand* intelligence tool. It tells you which companies need help and how urgently. They serve different parts of your workflow. Most of our subscribers use both — LinkedIn to find candidates, Hot Leads to find the companies worth pitching.

### "I can search Indeed/LinkedIn Jobs myself."

You can, and you probably do. The question is whether you want to spend 2-3 hours a week doing it, or whether you want a scored, filtered list on your desk Monday morning. We are not selling access to job postings — those are public. We are selling the signal extraction and prioritization layer on top. The difference between "VP of Sales posted at a company" and "VP of Sales, reports to CEO, growth hire, building team of 8, $250K-$350K, posted 2 days ago" is the difference between a lead and a qualified opportunity.

### "How fresh is this data?"

The feed is generated from postings scraped within the last 7 days. You receive it every Monday. Most postings in the feed are 1-5 days old. We also flag "immediate" hires — roles where the language suggests urgency — so you can prioritize speed on those.

### "How do you know it's a growth hire and not a backfill?"

We extract signals from the job description text. Phrases like "build the team from the ground up," "first hire in this function," "reporting directly to the CEO," and "rapidly growing" are tagged and categorized. We also look for structural signals: is this a new function at the company? Is the team size mentioned as zero? These are not perfect — no automated system is — but they are right often enough to be a meaningful filter. And when we are wrong, it is usually in your favor: a role we tagged as "growth hire" that turns out to be a strategic replacement is still a retained search opportunity.

### "What industries/functions do you cover?"

The current feed covers all industries and functions. We scrape broadly. Most of the signal-rich leads tend to be in sales leadership, operations, finance (CFO), and general management. If you have a specific vertical focus, we can tune the feed to prioritize those roles — that is available in the Professional tier.

### "$297/month seems expensive for a list."

It is not a list. It is a research function. The alternative is paying someone $20/hour for 3 hours a week to do manual job board monitoring — that is $240/month before benefits and management time, and they will miss things because they are human and the volume is high. At $297/month, you are getting better coverage, better signal extraction, and zero management overhead. If the feed sources one placement conversation per quarter, the ROI is several hundred to one.

## LinkedIn DM (Cold Outreach)

**Version A — Direct:**

Hi {{FIRST_NAME}} — I built a tool that scans executive job postings and flags the ones most likely to need retained search: VP+ growth hires, CEO direct reports, first-hire roles with real salary budgets. I send a scored list every Monday. Happy to send you this week's for free if you want to see what it looks like. No pitch — just the data.

**Version B — Warm/mutual connection:**

Hi {{FIRST_NAME}} — saw you focus on {{THEIR_SPECIALTY}} placements. I run a weekly intelligence feed for executive recruiters that pulls VP+ growth hires with real budgets and ranks them by signal strength (reporting structure, team-building mandates, urgency). Would you find a free sample week useful? Just want honest feedback on whether it is worth anything to someone in your seat.

**Version C — After engaging with their content:**

Hi {{FIRST_NAME}} — your post about {{TOPIC}} was sharp. Related to that: I have been building a data product that extracts hiring signals from executive job postings — growth hire vs. backfill, reporting structure, salary confirmation. Could I send you a sample week? Think of it as a Monday morning cheat sheet for knowing which companies are in hiring mode.
