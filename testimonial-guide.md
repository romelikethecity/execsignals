# ExecSignals — Testimonial Collection Guide

Use this after users have received 3-4 Monday Briefs.

## What to Ask (Email, Not a Call)

1. **"What did you do with last Monday's brief?"** — Reveals actual behavior, not opinions.
2. **"Has anything from the brief led to a client conversation?"** — Tracks real outcomes.
3. **"What would you miss if I stopped sending it?"** — The PMF litmus test. If they name a specific feature, that's your wedge.

## What You Want to Hear

### "I stopped doing ___" (Replacement Signal — Strongest)
- "I cancelled my Monday morning Indeed ritual"
- "I stopped asking my researcher to pull job board reports"
- "I dropped a LinkedIn Recruiter seat"

These mean you've replaced a workflow, not just added to it. That's retention.

### "I used it to ___" (Action Signal — Proves Utility)
- "I pitched a company from the brief before they'd even engaged a firm"
- "I walked into a comp negotiation with your salary benchmarks and the client asked where I got them"
- "I forwarded the PDF one-pager to a client and they asked if I could do this for their other divisions"
- "I filtered the Excel by geography and found three roles in my market I'd missed"

These prove specific features are driving real behavior.

### "I didn't expect ___" (Surprise Signal — Reveals Hidden Value)
- "I didn't realize how many roles never show up in my LinkedIn alerts"
- "The growth hire vs. backfill distinction changed how I prioritize outreach"
- "I started using the market intel section more than the leads themselves"

Surprises indicate you're delivering value the buyer didn't know they needed. That's word-of-mouth fuel.

### "It paid for itself when ___" (ROI Signal — Justifies Price)
- "One lead from week 2 turned into a $90K placement fee"
- "I pitched two companies from the brief in the first month"
- "My researcher now spends those 3 hours on candidate sourcing instead"

## Landing Page Placement

Plan for 3 testimonial slots on the landing page:
1. **Replacement quote** — between Value Props and Market Intel
2. **Action quote** — after Market Intel or Email Preview
3. **ROI quote** — near Pricing section

## Red Flags

- "It's interesting" (no action taken)
- "I skimmed it" (not integrated into workflow)
- "The data is cool but..." (value unclear)

These mean the format or content isn't clicking. Dig into what would make it actionable for them.
